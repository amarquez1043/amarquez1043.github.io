        I am a <span id= "majors">journalism and anthropology</span> student at the Univerisity of Maryland. My professional journalism experience includes local news beat reporting and political reporting from Capitol Hill. On campus, I serve as the student chair of the TerpsVote Coalition, which is a group of students, staff and faculty working to raise student voter rates at the University of Maryland through voter registration and education programs. I also serve as the Director of Civic Engagement for the University of Maryland Student Government Association, where I work with others to advocate for student interests and plan initiatives to benefit the entire student body. My TerpsVote and student government positions are politically neutral and non-partisan.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am a self-starter and work well with others to succeed in common goals. I am great at working efficiently to produce quality work on quick deadlines and I am always happy to jump in to new projects to assist my team. For example, as a reporting intern at McClatchy, I volunteered to sit in on the House Intelligence Committee's public impeachment hearings as soon as they were announced and as a result, I got the opportunity to sit through five full days of hearings, <span id= "majors">reporting and live-tweeting</span> from the hearing room each time. </p>
