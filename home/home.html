    <p>I am a recent college graduate with a degree in <span id= "majors">journalism and anthropology</span> from the University of Maryland, College Park. I recently started working as a Digital Associate at CNBC, covering finance, markets and more for the digital video team. Prior to my start at CNBC, I spent four months as an intern at NBC News, helping with broadcast coverage on MSNBC and writing for NBC News Digital. At NBC, I learned how best to unearth stories on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Youtube. Digging through these sites is where I found some of my best pitches about things like states trying to tax Big Tech and prisoners' technological knowledge gap. Even when assigned stories, I often found my best sources, like NFT artists and a streamer grandma on social media platforms. Feel free to check out these stories and more of my work at NBC News <a href="https://amarquez1043.github.io/work/work.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>As a Silver Spring, Maryland, native I always dreamed of reporting in Washington, D.C. For the Fall 2019 semester, I had the opportunity to do so at the McClatchy D.C. Bureau. I covered various congressional and national news for McClatchy, with a focus on covering the Texas congressional delegation for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. I've previously written for The Diamondback in College Park and for Washington Gardener Magazine in Silver Spring.</p>
    <p>My parents are from El Salvador and Ukraine and I speak three languages – Russian, Spanish and English. My passion for journalism began when I joined my high school newspaper and began covering issues important to the Silver Spring community, like Board of Education initiatives, new demographic trends in the school district and opportunity gaps between students of different socio-economic backgrounds. When I'm not reading, writing or listening to the news, I'm probably playing with my two cats, Lio and Leto.</p>
