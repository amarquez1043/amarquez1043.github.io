  <p>Alexandra is a junior journalism and anthropology major at the University of Maryland, College Park. She is a Silver Spring, MD, native who always dreamed of reporting in D.C. and covering one of the three branches of national government. Last fall, she had the opportunity to do so at the McClatchy D.C. Bureau. Alexandra covered various congressional and national news for McClatchy, with a focus on covering the Texas congressional delegation for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. She’s previously written for The Diamondback in College Park and Washington Gardener Magazine in Silver Spring.</p>
  <p>As a current multi-platform journalism student at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism, she is seeking internships in political and national journalism. On campus, she is also the student chair of the TerpsVote Coalition, a non-profit, non-partisan group of students, staff and faculty working to raise student voter rates on campus. One of the group's most important efforts is educating students about politics, the political process and voting. TerpsVote also connects students with resources that help them register to vote, request absentee ballots and make detailed plans to vote.</p>
  <p>Alexandra’s parents are from El Salvador and Ukraine and she speaks three languages – Russian, Spanish and English. Her passion for journalism began when she joined her high school newspaper and began covering issues important to the Silver Spring community, like Board of Education initiatives, new demographic trends in the school district and opportunity gaps between students of different socio-economic backgrounds. When Alexandra’s not reading, writing or listening to the news, she’s probably playing with her two cats.</p>
